**IrrigFlo** is an open source java software that aims to be an alternative to commercial hydraulics softwares like Bently's FlowMaster and others. 

The project will be written in java from scratch including all the core libraries.

This page will serve as the timeline documentation of the project and will be updated as often as the project's push to the repository.

### Day 1 - May 7, 2018
- I started structuring the project and the library at day 1 trying to make something work for SVP (Smallest Viable Product).
- Started the class 'OpenChannel', this is the base class of all open channels.
- Started the class 'RectangularOpenChannel' which is a child of OpenChannel class.

### Day 2 - May 8, 2018
- Continue work on the library and incorporating some implementations.
- Stays at 'RectangularOpenChannel' class.
- I also started writing exception handling at this stage. I don't know when you should be doing that but I did it anyway.
