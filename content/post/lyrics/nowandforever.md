Whenever I'm weary<br>
From the battle that raged in my head<br>
You make sense of madness<br>
When my sanity hangs by a thread

I lose my way but still you seem to understand<br>
Now and forever,I will be your man.

Sometimes I just hold you<br>
To caught up in me to see<br>
I'm holding a fortune<br>
That heaven has given to me

I'll try to show you each and every way I can<br>
Now and forever, I will be your man.

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure<br>
That I won't be alone anymore<br>
If I'd only known you were there all the time<br>
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand<br>
Now and forever, I will be your man<br>
Now and forever, I will be your man
