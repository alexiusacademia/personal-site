Say you, say me<br>
Say it for always<br>
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me<br>
Say it together<br>
Naturally

I had a dream<br>
I had an awesome dream<br>
People in the park<br>
Playin' games in the dark

And what they play<br>
Was a masquerade<br>
From behind the walls of doubt<br>
A voice was crying out.

Say you, say me<br>
Say it for always<br>
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me<br>
Say it together<br>
Naturally

As we go down<br>
Life's lonesome highway<br>
Since the hardest thing to do<br>
Is to find a friend or two.

That helping hand<br>
Someone who understand<br>
When you feel you lost your way<br>
You've got someone there to say<br>
I'll show you

Say you, say me<br>
Say it for always<br>
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me<br>
Say it together<br>
Naturally

So you think you know the answers<br>
Oh, no<br>
While the whole world's got you dancin'<br>
That's right<br>
I'm telling you

It's time to start believing<br>
Oh, yes<br>
Believing who you are<br>
You are a shining star

Say you, say me<br>
Say it for always, oh<br>
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me<br>
Say it together<br>
Naturally<br>
Say it together<br>
Naturally.
