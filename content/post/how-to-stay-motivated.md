> Starting a project is easy, finishing it comes the challenge.

Most of us came to a time where we are very eager or excited to start a project out of an idea. Having to imagine that our idea could make a very little impact or change the world gives us a very excited feeling. This excitement leads us to make steps thinking that those ideas alone can cut it. This is where we already fail even before we start the journey.
