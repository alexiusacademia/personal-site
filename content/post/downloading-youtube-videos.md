Hi everyone! In this tutorial, I will be showing you one of the methods in downloading videos from youtube.

### Why another tutorial?
I know you may have already seen a lot of tutorials regarding downloading youtube videos. That may be true, but most of them uses a web-based applications or online applications that can be used using your browsers. Most or all of these applications don't allow you in downloading any type of video. Some are protected, hence the application don't allow it. It can be a hassle especially if you really need something that can't be download, maybe for educational purposes. Because of this, I present to you this tutorial.

All part of the tutorial is a direct to the point instructions with some explanations to make you clearly understand the process especially if you are not very familiar with the commandline or command prompt or the terminal in other operating systems.
