I have been programming for more than seven years now. To all the languages I learned, I guess I never even touched at 50% of the language. Yes I have made a lot of projects and real world softwares in the past, but something tells me that my understanding of a language that I'm using prevents me to achieve something more. This makes me think that I can do more if I achieve to learn at least 90% of the language that I use to a certain project.

One thing that comes into my mind as for what is the reason why I can't finish learning all the aspect of a language is because of some distractions.

### The Problem
After observing myself, I think the biggest distraction that I have is that I am so eager to build something already while I am still learning the language. I am excited to apply the language that I learn. Just make something works thrilled me not knowing that I can do better, that I can make better solutions.

And so my problem regarding this is the lack of focus. I became excited everytime I accomplish or finish a project that I forget to continue to learn a language.

Although learning the programming language is not a major activities in computer science, but to learn programming itself regardless of the language, it still plays a major role during the implementation of a solution specially on large projects.

And so I decided to get most of a programming language this time. Even atleast 80-90% would give me better solution and better alternatives than I had in the past.

### The Solution
I am not saying the being eager to build something in the early stage is a bad idea. Absolutely not. Building something is still a really way to learn from a programmer's perspective or even some aspects, not just in computer science.

My focus in this article is how could I learn a language so that I can efficiently apply it to real worlds problems. By learning, I mean, while still building things, or in this case, softwares along the learning process.

What I observed from some people is that if other people knows what they should be doing, they will continue on doing that. This simple idea gives me a solution. What if I tell some people that I will study and code in java for 365 days? This is not restricted to studying only but to building some projects as well.

So this is what I did, on April 13, 2018, I posted in facebook what will I be doing in the challenge. I labeled it "#365DaysJavaChallenge" as I will use the java programming language in my challenge. What I pledged is that everyday for the next 365 days, I will be coding in java whether for learning or for a project for a minimum of a measurable learning time or feature creation time for each day.

So far this is what I did and hopefully it works. I hope to see you guys at the end. I will be updating this blog post after I completed the challenge that I put to myself and hopefully some of you would join me by creating your own challenge similar to this. Thanks for reading.
