## Moment-Capacity vs. Steel Area Relationship

This problem is given to our subject in Advanced Design of Reinforced Concrete in my master's degree of Structural Engineering.

### I. Problem:

------

Draw the Moment-Capacity and Tension Steel (Mn - As) relationship curve of a reinforced concrete t-beam of different cases with parameters as follows:

**General Cases**

| Cases  | fc'  | fy   |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Case 1 | 20   | 300  |
| Case 2 | 30   | 300  |
| Case 3 | 20   | 400  |
| Case 4 | 30   | 400  |

**Beam Properties**

| Property                                            | Value                | Unit |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
| f'c                                                 | [20, 40, 20, 40]     | MPa  |
| fy                                                  | [300, 300, 400, 400] | MPa  |
| Effective depth (d)                                 | 435                  | mm   |
| Web width (b~w~)                                    | 250                  | mm   |
| Thickness of flange (t~f~)                          | 125                  | mm   |
| $\epsilon$~cu~                                      | 0.003                |      |
| E~s~                                                | 200,000              | MPa  |
| f'c reference                                       | 28                   | MPa  |
| Student number (last 3-digits)                      | 338                  |      |
| Factor based of on reversed student number $\alpha$ | 0.833                |      |
| $bf = bw + \alpha \cdot tf$                         | 2550                 | mm   |

$\beta 1$ is solved for each value of $f'c$.

```python
fcPrime = [20, 40, 20, 40]
fy = [300, 300, 400, 400]
β1 = []
# Calculate for corresponding β1
for fcx in fcPrime:
    if fcx <= fc_base:
        β1.append(0.85)
    else:
        β1.append(round(0.85 - (0.05 / 7)*(fcx - fc_base), 3))
```

$\beta 1$ now is `[0.85, 0.764, 0.85, 0.764]`



### II. Solutions / Methodology

------

#### A. Assumptions

- In this problem, tensile strength of concrete is neglected, so that at $As = 0$, $Mn = 0$.
- Stress block used is the Whitney stress block distribution for simplicity of calculation.

#### B. Solution

The solution to the problem is to solve each cases in one go using programming language **python** by looping through a number of four (4) cases.

1. Create list of arrays to hold values for moments and steel areas for each case:

   ```python
   # With initial values of zeros (0's) for Mn and As for each case
   M = ([0], [0], [0], [0])
   As = ([0], [0], [0], [0])
   ```

2. Now for looping on 4 cases:

2.1. Calculation of balanced steel area, needed for the curve and analysis limit.

   ```python
   for i in range(4):
       c_bal = 600 * d / (600 + fy[i])           # Location of neutral axis
       a_bal = β1[i] * c_bal                     # Equivalent height of rectangular
                                                 #  compression block
       z_bal = a_bal - tf if a_bal > tf else 0   # Web component of compression zone
                                                 #  if a > tf
       As_bal = (0.85 * fcPrime[i] * bf * tf + 0.85 * fcPrime[i] * bw * z_bal) 
                           / fy[i]
       As_limit = 2 * As_bal                     # Limit to be analyzed
       As_trial = 100                            # Start calculating here for As
   ```
2.2. Create a loop that tries for each value of As, then calculates the corresponding moment capacity, Mn until As_limit is reached.

   ```python
   while (As_trial <= As_limit):
       a = 10                                    # Trial for height of stress block
       c = a / β1[i]                             # Neutral axis height (kd)
       As_calc = 0                               # Variable to hold calculated As
                                                 # To be compared with As_trial
   ```

2.3. Find the height of stress block by trial and error

   ```python
   	   while (As_calc < As_trial):
           c = a / β1[i]                         # Neutral axis height (kd)
           fs = 600 * (d - c) / c                # Calculated fs
           if (fs >= fy[i]):                     # Use fy if steel yields
               fs = fy[i]
           Ac = area_of_tbeam(bf, tf, bw, a)     # Calling a function to calculate
                                                 #  area of a given t-beam
           As_calc = 0.85 * fcPrime[i] * Ac / fs # Calculate As by equilibrium
           a += 0.02                             # Increment a with 0.02mm
   ```

2.4. Nominal moment is now then calculated by taking a moment at centroid of stress block

```python
       Mn = As_calc * fs * (d - centroid_of_tbeam(bf, tf, bw, a))
       
       # Add the calculated moment and steel area to the array
       M[i].append(Mn/1000**2)
       As[i].append(As_calc)
```

2.5. To finalize a single loop, trial for steel area is incremented by $100 mm^2$ each time

```python
   As_trial += 100
```



This covers the whole process of the calculation. To add some more observations, some data have been collected and inserted to the actual code, (not shown in the main process above) to understand the result more deeply like; maximum nominal moment, strain at the compression fiber and actual steel stress is also collected to find if steel yields in each loop.



### III. Results / Charts

---

The resulting graph for all cases is shown below:

***Figure 2: Moment Capacity vs. Steel Reinforcement relationship curve***

Also, a snippet of the resulting table of calculated $As$ and $Mn$ is shown below showing the transition between the steel yielding and not yielding.

***Figure 3: Snippet of case 4 results***

Note that the snippet above is part of the **Case 4** of this problem.



### IV. Comments/Observations

---

Following are comments and findings in this problem set.

- Case 1 and 3 shows nearly same amount of Moment Capacity despite having different values of $fy$. It can be noted though that the one with greater $fy$ (Case 3), reaches its max moment with less steel area ($As$). Similar is true with Case 2 and 4.
- For each case, it can be noted that at a specific point, each curve changed its slope abruptly, from steep to almost flat. This point is the transition between under and over reinforced or at balanced steel reinforcement. Numerical data for this point is also presented in the ***figure 2*** above. Beyond this point, is where the concrete yields at strain of 0.003 and steel no longer reaches its yield strength.
- It was also observed that when steel no longer yields, moment capacity doesn't increase much with respect to steel even if we increase its area significantly. This is observed in the part of each curve with small slope.
