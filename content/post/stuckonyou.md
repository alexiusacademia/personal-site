Stuck on you<br>
Got this feeling down deep in my soul<br>
That I just can't lose<br>
Guess I'm on my way

Needed a friend<br>
And the way I feel now <br>
I guess I'll be with you 'till the end<br>
Guess I'm on my way<br>
Might be glad you stayed

Stuck on you<br>
Been a fool too long<br>
I guess it's time for me to come on home<br>
Guess I'm on my way

So hard to see<br>
That a woman like you<br>
Could wait around for a man like me<br>
Guess I'm on my way<br>
Might be glad you stayed

Ohh I'm leavin' on the midnight train tomorrow<br>
And I know just where I'm going<br>
I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away<br>
'Cause this time little Darlin'<br>
I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you<br>
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul<br>
That I just can't lose<br>
Guess I'm on my way

Needed a friend<br>
And the way I feel now <br>
I guess I'll be with you 'till the end<br>
Guess I'm on my way<br>
Might be glad you stayed
